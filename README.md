# TeamsInReview
TeamsInReview is an application that generates a slideshow with Teams usage information for the past 180 days. The app allows users to click on the personal tab in Teams to retrieve usage information via a simple query against the Graph API. It then summarizes the data and presents it in a visually appealing HTML5 slideshow that can feature text, text over a picture, text over a video, and more. The app aims to provide users with a fun and informative experience similar to that offered by Spotify, Strava, and other applications that provide periodic overviews of user activities.

## Technology

TeamsInReview was created using Razor components with the Teams Toolkit, and can be hosted on an Azure App Service.

## Deployment
